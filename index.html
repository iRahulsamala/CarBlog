   <h1 class="carsName" id="car1Name">Bugatti Chiron</h1>
   <p class="carPara" id="car1Para">
    The main carry over component from the Veyron is the 7,993 cc (8.0 L; 487.8 cu in) quad-turbocharged W16 engine, though it is heavily updated. The engine in the Chiron has a peak power output of 1,103.25 kW (1,479 hp; 1,500 PS) 
    at 6,700 rpm and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft) of torque starting from 2,000 to 6,000 rpm.[13] The engine in the most powerful variant of its predecessor, the Veyron Super Sportgenerates 221 kW (296 hp; 300 PS) less than the new Chiron,
     while the engine in the original Veyron generates 367 kW (492 hp; 499 PS) less power.[14][15]
    Like its predecessor, the Veyron, the Chiron utilises a carbon fibre body structure, independent suspension and a Haldex All-wheel drive system.[16][17][18] The carbon fibre body has a stiffness of 50,000 Nm per degree.[19]
    The Chiron can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.4 seconds according to the manufacturer, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 6.5 seconds and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 13.6 seconds. In a world-record-setting test at the time in 2017, the Chiron reached 400 km/h (249 mph) in 32.6 seconds, after which it needed 9.4 seconds to brake to standstill.[20]

   <h1 class="carsName" id="car2Name">Lamborghini's Veneno</h1>
   <p class="carPara" id="car2Para">
    The engine is a development of the Aventador's 6.5-litre V12 and generates a power output of 750 PS (552 kW; 740 hp) 
    at 8,400 rpm and 690 N⋅m (509 lb⋅ft) of torque at 5,500 rpm. The increase in power was achieved by enlarging the air intakes and modifying the exhaust system.[4][5]
    The Veneno is Lamborghini's interpretation of a racing prototype built for the road. The front of the car is designed for maximum airflow and improved downforce. 
    The redesigned front and rear arches direct air around the car in order to reduce excessive lift and aid in generating downforce.
     The smooth underbody ensures that the airflow is not interrupted. The large carbon-fibre rear wing connected to the car via an LMP-style central fin is three-way adjustable.
      The wheels of the car (measuring 20-inch at the front and 21-inch at the rear) have a turbine-like design and direct
      air to cool the car's carbon ceramic braking system. The center lock wheels allow for easy installation and removal. 
    The car utilises Pirelli P-Zero tyres.[6].

   <h1 class="carsName" id="car3Name">Dodge Challenger</h1>
   <p class="carPara" id="car3Para">
    The performance model was the Challenger R/T (Road/Track), with a 383 cu in (6.3 L) "Magnum" V8, rated at 335 hp (250 kW); 300 hp (224 kW) for 1971, due to a drop in compression. The standard transmission was a 3-speed manual. Optional R/T engines were the 375 hp (280 kW) 440 cu in (7.2 L) Magnum, the 390 hp (291 kW) 440 cu in (7.2 L) Six-Pack and the 426 cu in (7.0 L) Hemi rated at 425 hp (431 PS; 317 kW) at 5,000 rpm and 490 lb⋅ft (664 N⋅m) of torque at 4,000 rpm. The R/T was available in either the hardtop or convertible. The Challenger R/T came with a Rallye instrument cluster that included a 150 mph (240 km/h) speedometer, an 8,000 rpm tachometer and an oil pressure gauge.[15] The shaker hood scoop was not available after 1971.

      <h1 class="carsName" id="car4Name">McLaren</h1>
      <p class="carPara" id="car4Para">
        The roof is a single piece of carbon fibre and takes 11 seconds for operation, 6 seconds quicker than the 650S Spider. The roof can be operated at speeds up to 50 km/h (31 mph). The Spider uses the "flying buttress" as used on all convertible McLaren models. There is an added window on the buttress of the car to increase rear visibility. The retractable window between the roll-over hoops is carried over from the 650S Spider.
        The engine and the transmission remain the same as the coupé with the engine generating the same amount of power. The Spider can accelerate to 97 km/h (60 mph) from a standstill in 2.9 seconds, to 193 km/h (120 mph) in 7.9 seconds and on to a top speed of 341 km/h (212 mph) with the top closed. The top speed reduces by 16 km/h (10 mph) with the top retracted.

         The first generation of the BMW Z4 consists of the BMW E85 (roadster version) and BMW E86 (coupe version) sports cars. The E85/E86 generation was produced from 2002 to 2008. The E85/E86 replaced the Z3 and is the third model in the BMW Z Series. Initial models were in the roadster (E85) body style, with the coupé (E86) body style being added in 2006. In February 2009, the BMW Z4 (E89) began production as the successor to the E85/E86.      </p>

      <h1 class="carsName" id="car8Name">Maserati Levante Trofeo</h1>
      <p class="carPara" id="car8Para">
        the Trofeo gets 572bhp (582bhp in non-Euro markets, something to do with exhausts and localised climate change), 538lb ft and 0-62mph in around four seconds. It’ll top out at getting on for 190mph. This is sufficient for a car that weighs 2,170kg without people or luggage in it. The slightly startling numbers make the Levante Trofeo the most powerful production car in the company’s history - the insane MC12 had 630bhp from its n/a V12, but isn’t considered series production.

      <p class="carPara" id="car9Para">
        h the Vantage's clamshell hood lies either a thrilling, thundering twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 or a monster of a twin-turbo 5.2-liter V-12. The base V-8 engine develops either 503 or 528 horsepower and 505 pound-feet of torque. The higher output V-8 is reserved for the track-inspired F1 Edition. The V-12 engine makes 690 horsepower, and Aston claims it's good for a 3.4-second zero-to-60-mph time—but we think that's a conservative estimate. We drove the F1 on track and discovered a meaningfully sharpened driving experience and recorded a 3.5-second run to 60 mph.

        Volvo XC90 T5 Momentum, which comes in the FWD drive type and provides seven-passenger seating. Under the hood is a direct-injected turbocharged engine that puts out 250 horsepower and 258-pounds of torque and can tow up to 4,000-pounds.
        If you want the handling performance of all-wheel-drive and enjoy the Momentum trim style, then select the Volvo XC90 T5 AWD Momentum. Performance numbers remain the same as the T5 Momentum, but EPA-estimated fuel economy is slightly less.
        Next up are the 2022 Volvo XC90 T6 Inscription and Momentum trims. The T6 powertrain is only available with AWD but gives you the option of six or seven-passenger seating. The T6 engine is supercharged and turbocharged to produce 316 horsepower and 295-pounds of torque, and it can tow up to 5,000-pounds.
